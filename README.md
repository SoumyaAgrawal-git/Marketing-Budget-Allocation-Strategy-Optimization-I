## Marketing-Budget-Allocation-Strategy-Optimization-I

### Problem Description

Marketing budgets now comprise 11 percent of total company budgets, based on a CMO survey sponsored by the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, Deloitte LLP, and the American Marketing Association. However, the effectiveness of marketing varies significantly: on the one hand, P&G cut more than $100 million in digital marketing spending because their digital ads were largely ineffective; on the other hand, Netflix plans a 54% boost in ad spending because they got very positive feedback in international markets.

One potential reason for such variation is the way of making marketing budget allocations. Namely, how much to invest in each advertisement platform. 

In this project, we use linear programming to build a simple marketing budget allocation strategy.
